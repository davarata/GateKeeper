# GateKeeper

A gate keeper for watching television during lockdown.

This project was a result of the lockdown during the COVID-19 crisis. With everyone at home during lockdown, my children started fighting about who watched television for how long. I also wanted to limit their time in front of the television.

Each child is allocated a set amount of time to watch television (connected to a laptop), which is password controlled. If the time is up, the viewer automatically closes.

This works on my PC (of course it does!), but failed to work on the laptop next to the television. It does not close the browser when viewing time is up. After this, I decided te rewrite it properly, but then my computer crashed. When I finally managed to buy a new one, life got in the way, and then schools where opened again. This meant the kids where no longer permanently at home and the immediate need for this program was no longer there.

I do want to finish it, since it keeps track of how many hours each 'user' spent watching TV (siblings fighting over who watched last and how long they watched), and certain things (like Youtube) is only allowed on weekends, but it is not a priority for now.

Feel free to use this code for whatever you want.
